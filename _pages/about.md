Welcome at the Institute of Massively Parallel Systems!

<p align="justify">
The institute of massively parallel systems (MPS) investiagates and teaches in the field of computer architecture, focussing on massively parallel systems.
These days massively parallel systems are present everywhere – in our smartphones, cars, supercomputers. They help us to do many things which were not possible before. For example, the recent stupendous success of machine learning, especially deep learning, is mainly due to the exponential increase in computational power. As such, machine learning is not new. Machine learning methods are around since the 1950s. What has predominately changed now is the computing power, with many-core processors such as GPUs as the main drivers. If these massively parallel processors are not utilized properly, they are very expensive in terms of power and energy consumption, which is not good as we aspire to reduce the carbon footprint tremendously. At MPS, we are working to make these computing devices more performance and energy-efficient from the architecture perspective and improve their programmability from a programmer’s perspective.

Dr. Sohan Lal is a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/" style="text-decoration:none">Technical University of Berlin</a> (TU Berlin), working on a DFG funded research project on advanced modeling and runtime support for large-scale HPC clusters <a href="https://celerity.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none">(Celerity)</a>. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from TU Berlin in August 2019. His dissertation was titled “Power Modeling and Architectural Techniques for Energy-Efficient GPUs” and was supervised by Prof. Ben Juurlink. At TU Berlin, he worked on two EU funded research projects on <a href="http://lpgpu.org/wp/" style="text-decoration:none">low power parallel computing on GPUs</a> (LPGPU), where he led several tasks, collaborated with consortium members to deliver joint deliverables and contributed significantly to their success. His Ph.D. dissertation work was also conducted in the context of LPGPU projects. For his dissertation, he investigated bottlenecks that cause low performance and low energy efficiency in GPUs and proposed architectural techniques to improve performance and energy efficiency. The results of the dissertation were published in several reputed conferences such as IPDPS, DATE, ISPASS. He won several grants such as HiPEAC travel grants, a HiPEAC collaboration grant to visit Prof. Henk Coporaal (TU/e) that led to a joint publication at DATE. He was a semifinalist at ACM SRC held at MICRO'18. He is interested in computer architecture in general and graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture in particular and his broad research interests include power and performance modeling, parallel systems, memory systems, heterogeneous computing, approximate computing, applied machine learning, and GPU security.

Before Ph.D., he received his masters from the <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/" style="text-decoration:none">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</a> (IITD) in 2011. Before that, he worked as a Lecturer at <a href="https://www.smvdu.ac.in/" style="text-decoration:none">Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University</a> (SMVDU), which was the first teaching stint that made him deeply passionate and excited about teaching and mentorship. He also worked as an IT specialist in the Government of India. He received his bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://gcetjammu.org.in/" style="text-decoration:none">Government College of Engineering and Technology</a> (GCET), Jammu, India in 2003.
